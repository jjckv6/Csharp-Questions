# Csharp-Questions

## What is a namespace?
1. A Namespace can be either used for organizing different classes and can control the scope of classes and or methods names in a program.

## What are value types?
2. Value types are varibles that can have values assigned to them directly.

## What are reference types?
3. Reference types are varibles that hold the address to the value they point to.

## What is an automatic property and how is it useful?
4. The main use of automatic property is the ability to make property-declaration easy to write and read with out using lengthy code, which makes it useful to its simplicity.

## What is the purpose of using statement?
5. It is basically used as an easy way to make sure disposable objects are used correctly.

## What are dynamic type variables?
6. Dynamic variables are checked at run time and is not subjected to type checking.

## What is the purpose of the is operator?
7. The operator compares objects to check for compatibility at runtime.

## What are generics and how is using them useful?
8. Generics are mainly used to make collection classes and which allow the coder to easily reuse code.

## What is the scope of a public member of a class?
9. When the scope of an object is public it can be used anywhere in the current program and even outside of the program.

## Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?
10. Yes, this is possible using a method.

## How do you sort an array?
11. The easiest way to do so is using the method Array.Sort().

## What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?
12. They are types what have no value at all and they support to the nullable T structure.

## What is an enumeration?
13. A list that holds a set of named constants.

## What is inheritance?
14. It is when a class takes on parts or attributes of another already made class.

## Is multiple inheritance supported?
15. No.

## What is the purpose of as operator?
16. The as operator is another way to test conversions between varibles.

## What is an object?
17. All types, predefined, and user-defined varibles are considered objects.

## What is the difference between a struct and a class?
18. Structs do not have inheritance like classes and are naturally public while classes are naturally private.

## What is the difference between continue and break statements?
19. Breaks are used to stop loops and continue simply keeps them going.

## What is this and how is it used?
20. The **this** keyword is used to refer to the current instance of a class and they are used to modify the first parameter of a extention method.

## What is try and catch and when are they used?
21. Try and catch are statements used in coding to handle different exceptions.

## How is exception handling done?
22. They can be done with if statments or Try and catch statments.

## What is finally and what is its purpose?
23. Finally is a statement that will executed if an exception is met or not in the code.

## List the differences between Array and ArrayList.
24. Arrays have a set size while an ArrayList is more dynamic and doesn't have a set size which allows the code to be more flexible. 

## What is an object?
25. All types, predefined, and user-defined varibles are considered objects.

## Define constructor.
26. Constructors are used to create classes or structs and allows the coder to set values and limit instanctiation.

## When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?
27. Var is implicitly declared and  the compiler determines the type at run time. 

## What is an abstract class?
28. Abstract are used to place abstract methods that can be used by other classes.

## What is an interface?
29. Interfaces are used for classes to so they can have multiple sources for one class.

## What is a method?
30. Methods are used to preform certain taskes in the program, like FindMax().

## What is a property?
31. Are much like methods but can read, write, or compute the value of a private field.

## What is an access specifier?
32. It tells the program is a method/class is public or private.

## What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?
33. Private and public, they either allow a class/method be used only in one program (private) or in other programs
 (Public).
## What is a collection?
34. Allows the coder to store objects of a related type.

## What is a Hash Table?
35. A collection of values that have keys with a hash code that points to the values.
